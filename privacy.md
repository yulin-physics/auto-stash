# Privacy Policy for AutoStash

**AutoStash does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

All data saved by the extension is stored locally on your own browser using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This data never leaves your device and is only used to restore form input when revisiting a page.

The extension does not track user behavior, does not log any usage, and does not interact with any third-party services or APIs.

If you remove the extension, all locally saved form data is automatically deleted by the browser.

If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.
